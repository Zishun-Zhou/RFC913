# SFTP
Outline of the project: This project uses Java to build a file transfer protocol described in RFC 913 Both server and client will be implemented. Port number can be changed to another number for testing. localhost will be used as the host-name for the server/client.

Precautions:

 1. The USER, ACCT, and PASS commands It is mandatory that these commands work in implementation.

 2. The remaining commands that should be used: TYPE, LIST, CDIR, KILL, NAME, DONE, RETR, and STOR.

 3. Keep the username, account, and passwords, in plain text file on the server side or in any other format (e.g., berkeley database) as required.
